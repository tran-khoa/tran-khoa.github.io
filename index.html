            <p>
              The brain can learn continuously without forgetting past skills,
              unlike traditional machine learning models that struggle with
              continual learning. We provide a 'fast and slow learning' paradigm
              towards solving this problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, we observe that standard supervised learning of neural
              networks leads to a configuration, where the network becomes
              invariant to task-irrelevant features, i.e. also being invariant
              to features relevant to previous tasks ('neural collapse').
              Instead, in a <i>slow learning phase</i>, we suggest to first
              learn feedforward weights to extract general features by proxy of
              a view-invariance learning objective: The training signal is
              thereby provided by smoothly moving visual stimuli, suggesting
              object identity. The machine learning equivalent is contrastive
              self-supervised learning, where the network is trained to be
              invariant towards randomly generated distortions (e.g. random
              crops, flips, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, a neural collapse configuration in order to readout the class
              via a linear classifier. Inspired by our previous work, we train
              task-specific modulations - augmenting the feedfoward computation
              - towards such a configuration (<i>fast learning</i>). We show
              that alternating between these two phases allows in a standard
              continual learning setup does not lead to catastrophic forgetting
              of task-relevant features, but requires keeping track of drifting
              class-clusters (readout healing).

              How does the brain adapt its computation to dynamically changing
              environments and tasks? We propose that dendritic modulation is a
              suitable candidate for these requiremets. We show in biophysically
              realistic simulations that task-solving modulations learned via a
              Hebbian learning rule modulated by a global error signal can be
              used to solve multiple tasks. Towards more biologically plausible
              machine learning, we propose task-modulated contrastive learning
              (TMCL) as a layer-local, semi-supervised, multi-task learning
              algorithm.

              A simple approach to translate speech from one language to text in
              another language is to generate a transcript using ASR (automatic
              speech recognition) model, which is then translated using a
              separate MT (machine translation) model, i.e. cascaded speech
              trnslation. We discuss the potential benefits of training these
              two models jointly. Our investigations highlight that the benefits
              of such joint training suggested by previous work can be explained
              away by in-domain fine-tuning both ASR and MT models whilst using
              the traditional cascaded approach.

              As the vocabulary size of language models increases, training the
              cross-entropy loss across the entire vocabulary becomes
              computationally expensive. However, it is unclear why certain
              sampling-based training criteria such as noise contrastive
              estimation (NCE) work well in practice compared to others. Here,
              starting from three fundamental criteria, namely mean squared
              error (MSE), binary cross-entropy (BCE), and cross-entropy (CE),
              we explicitly write out sampling-based versions such as importance
              sampling, NCE and standard Monte Carlo sampling and derive a
              'correction term' that - if applied during inference - makes the
              sampling-based training criteria perform similarly to NCE.

              We show in the context of machine translation that while relative
              positional encodings are not beneficial for performance on
              sequence lengths seen during training, they are crucial for
              generalization to longer sequences. Nowadays, this fact is widely
              acknowledged outside of machine translation (e.g.
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12284"
                >Csordas, Irie and Schmidhuber, 2021</a

              state-of-the-art models.
